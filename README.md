The application that we made is designed give the user current NFL player information per request. It also gives you the selected teams current schedule.
The APIâ€™s that we have chosen for this app are API Sports, which gives information about players for a selected team. We have also added a Ticketmaster API, which gives the user selected teams upcoming games. The CSS framework we used was Tailwind.
User Story: When I search for a team I want to see a list of players and games. When I search through players I want their stats and picture. When I see games I want to be able to buy tickets for them.
