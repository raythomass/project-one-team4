The application that we made is designed gives the user current NFL player information per request. It also gives you the selected team's current schedule.
The API’s that we have chosen for this app is API Sports, which gives information about players for a selected team. We have also added a Ticketmaster API, which gives the user-selected teams upcoming games. The CSS framework we used was Tailwind.
User Story: When I search for a team I want to see a list of players and games. When I search through players I want their stats and picture. When I see games I want to be able to buy tickets for them.
